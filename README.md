## Annotations

The following annotations are implemented:

 - `@after`: marks a feature to be run *after* another feature. Features are sorted to ensure that they run in the proper order. 
 - `@pending`: marks a feature or scenario as skipped
 - `@thisonly`: tells the runner to only run this feature. All depending features are run before.
